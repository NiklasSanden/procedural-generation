For marching cubes:
	Each chunk should have the same vertex buffer, just the coordinates for each cell
	Then use instancing with different model matrices to render all of them (render as points)
	Then use a geometry shader to transform each cell into up to 12 vertices
	The fragment shader will work as usual
