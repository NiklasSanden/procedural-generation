For marching cubes:
	Each chunk should have the same vertex buffer, just the coordinates for each cell
	Then use instancing with different model matrices to render all of them (render as points)
	Then use a geometry shader to transform each cell into up to 12 vertices
	The fragment shader will work as usual
TODO:
	When adding the chunks that should be rendered as instances, 
	make sure to loop through them around the player like a circle, 
	instead of from bottom, left, back to top, right, front
	Otherwise we draw over previously drawn fragments when looking in one direction, 
	and not in the other, which makes the framerate inconsistent depending on where we are facing
